Project title: Dispersed

MVP --
a react app that controls crud functions for a database of dispersed campsites.

User Story:
The user can create, read, update, and destroy a list of dispersed campsites.  The user gives the campsite a name and coordinates (required)(stored in Mongo via express api).  There is also an option to add notes about the site.

Once entered, the sites can be retrieved from the db and shown as a marker on a google map (third party api)

----------
Stretch Goals:
weather API call
Login page with bcrypt
Use react-strap to style the app
color, typography, images
add a User model to the express api
